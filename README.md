## Heather Fryling's Algo Coding Practice

This repo contains implementations of algorithms and data structures I've studied in Python and/or Java. It's meant as a record of my progress and a resource for me to study from.

All algos/data structures include test files to make sure they fulfill their contracts.

* With the exception of Cracking the Coding Interview problems or those which are still in progress.
