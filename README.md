# AlgoStudy
## Heather Fryling's Algo Coding Practice

This repo contains implementations of algorithms and data structures I've studied in Python and/or Java. It's meant as a record of my progress and a resource for me to study from.

Completed algos/data structures include test files to make sure they fulfill their contracts.

* Cracking the Coding Interview problems/test cases and a few others are still in progress, as this is an ongoing project.
