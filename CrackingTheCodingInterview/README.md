Algos in the Cracking the Coding Interview section do not have pytests. Instead,
they just have print statements.
Algos in this section also are not documented, again due to quick study.

TODO:
* Write real tests instead of just print statements.
  Current print statements are due to time pressure preparing for coding interviews.
* Document functions.
